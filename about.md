Hi there! I am Akshay Ranganath. I am a tech enthusiast and an amateur photographer.

Over time, I have been in the role of a Java developer, a perl code-base maintainer, and technical lead. For a long time now, I have been in **Professional Services** at [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/").

In my current role, I consult with our customers on various topics ranging from Web performance optimizations, better use of content deliver networks ([CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)), tweaking the setup for a better SEO, helping adopt the APIs for a more devOps setup and anything else that interests me!

If you'd like to send me a note, I am at [twitter](https://twitter.com/rakshay) Â and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshayranganath).
