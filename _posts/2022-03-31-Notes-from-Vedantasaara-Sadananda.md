## Why this book?

During the Covid crisis, I took up a habit of walking regularly as an exercise. Apart from helping may stay fit, it offered me about an hour of uninterrupted time. During this period, I started listening to the talks of [Swami Sarvapriyananda](https://www.vedantany.org/resident-swamis/). I started by listening to his introductory talks like ["Who am I?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGKFTUuJppU), based the teachings of [Mandukya Upanishad](https://www.swami-krishnananda.org/mand/Mandukya_Upanishad.pdf). After listening to a series of his lectures, I started to listen to the [Bhagwad Gita series](https://soundcloud.com/vedantany/sets/bhagavad-gita-swami). While doing so, I realized that my foundations in _Vedanta_ were a bit weak and I needed a firm footing.

While researching about it, I came across a [lecture series on _Vedanta-sara_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6FbNFjDJqk&list=PLDqahtm2vA70ccqIRFR_lipqKvxrHBRRw). Alternatively, you listen to the lectures on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5IrDmqXhiGwwyQcIUjRhtB?si=1d1f232185bf40fb&nd=1) as well.

The lectures are based on an introductory book on _Vedanta_. Written by _Sadananda_ in the 15th century, [this book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedantasara_(of_Sadananda) is considered as an introductory text into the philosophy of _Advaita Vedanta_.

In this article, I wanted to note down the main highlights as a reference for myself and for anyone who is pursuing the same. 

If you'd like to purchase the book, the book is available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Vedanta-sara-Sadananda-Yogindra/dp/8175051108/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=vedantasara+of+sadananda+by+nikhilananda+swami&qid=1648751909&sprefix=vedantasara+%2Caps%2C129&sr=8-1). Generally, the Advaita teachers appear to recommend these 3 books as introductory material:

* Vedanta-sara of Sadananda by Sadananda Yogindra
* Drg-Drsya-Viveka: An Inquiry Into the Nature of the Seer and the Seen by Shankara
* Aparokshanubhuti: Or Self-Realization of Sri Sankaracharya by Shankara

Generally, there is a bundled deal - so do take a look and get them together.

## Notes from the book

### Definition of the cosmic and individual being

| Aggregate Aspect                      | Name                        | Individual Aspect                          | Name               | Characteristic | Kosha                  |  State (Mandukya) |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------------------|------------------|
|                                       | Brahman                     |                                            | Jiva (जीव)         | Other terms    |  -                     |    तुरीय           |

This is a summary of all the various breakdown of the core concepts. 

### Chapter 1: Preliminaries

> वेदान्तो नामोपनिषत्प्रमाणं .. (para 3)

Vedanta is the evidence of the Upanishads..
Vedanta - literally means the concluding of the philosophical portion of the Vedas

#### Journey of a Vedantin (pp 20-21)

* Performance of the daily obligatory rites leads >> acquisition of virtue; 
* Acquisition of virtue >> destruction of sin
* Destruction of sin >> purification of mind
* Purification of mind >> comprehension of संसार (Samsaara) / relative existence
* Comprehension of संसार >> leads to वैराग्य/renunciation
* वैराग्य >> Desire for liberation
* Desire for liberation >> search for its means
* Search >> practice of योगा (Yoga)
* योगा >> habitual tendency of the mind to settle in the Self
* Habit >> realized knowledge of passages like तत् त्वम् असि (Thou art That) 
* Knowledge >> destruction of ignorance & establishment in one's own Self

About वैराग्य (dispassion)
> A thing that has an origin cannot be permanent. Therefore dispassion should be practiced for _all_ things, even for the highest that man may attain - the position of _Brahma_, which is also as impermanent as any earthy object.

#### 6 Treasures of Mind

1. शम - control of the mind
2. दम - restraining the external organs (ie 5 sense organs & 5 organs of action)
3. उपरति - function of mind that keeps the restrained organs from going back to the objects of the senses
4. तितिक्षा - endurance / forbearance
5. समाधाना - constant concentration of the mind
6. श्रद्धा - faith (also working faith). 

श्रद्धा does not mean blind faith. It is like saying, have faith in a text book until you have learnt the subject. This kind of faith.

With the 6 treasure arises मुमुक्षत्वं, i.e., a strong desire for liberation.

#### Characteristics of a good गुरु (Guru)

* अकामहतत्वं - desirelessness
* अवृजिनत्वं - sinlessness


### Chapter 2: Superimposition (अध्यारोप)

> अध्यारोप (Adhyaropa) is the superimposition of the unreal on the real, like the false perception of a snake in a rope which is not a snake.

Main argument from Advaitins:
> Brahman alone is real, and ignorance and the entire material phenomenon of the world which are its products are only superimposition upon Brahman.

अवस्तु means an indescribable state i.e. which is other than existence and non-existence. अज्ञान (Agyaan) / ignorance is different from reality and unreality, as neuter is different from masculine and feminine.

> This ignorance is to be one or many according to the mode of observing it either collectively or individually. (para 35)
The collective ignorance is superior to the individual ignorance because the former is associated with Brahman and latter with जीव (Jiva).

#### Who is God?
In the traditional sense, ब्रह्मन् (Brahman) + अज्ञान (Agyaan) / माया (Maya) is called as सगुण ब्रह्मन्  (Saguna Brahman) or ईश्वर (Ishvara). This entity is the highest manifestation of the ब्रह्मन् (Brahman) in the phenomenon universe and hence refers to the "God".

ब्रह्मन् (Brahman) is indivisible. माया (Maya) can be divided infinitely. e.g.: Sun reflected in one large lake or infinite drops of water is still ignorance. The only real thing is the sun. (from lecture)

![water reflection](https://akshayranganath-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_fill,w_800,h_400/blog/lake-gc6e8e83dc_1920.jpg)

>The individual ignorance, associated with it (ब्रह्मन्) is also known as the causal body on account of its being the cause of egoism, etc. and as the blissful sheath because it is full of bliss and covers like a sheath;.. knows as dreamless sleep since into it everything is dissolved.. p47

In the waking state, the _Jiva_ is cognizant of the gross objects. In the deam state, the gross objects are dissolved into the subtle, and he is aware only of the subtle. In dreamless sleep, the gorss as well as the subtle objects are absorbed into the Ultimate Cause. Therefore, the state of dremless sleep has been described as the state of ultimate absorption or dissolution (प्रलय). p48

Individual _Jiva's_ dreamless sleep is called _sushuptih (सुषुप्ति:)_ while the dreamless sleep of the One is called _pralaya (प्रलय  )_. 

#### Mahavakyaa of Advaita Vedanta

* तत् त्वम् असि - "Thou art that"
* अयम् आत्मा ब्रह्म - "This self is Brahman"
* प्रज्ञानं ब्रह्म - "Consciousness is Brahman"
* अहं ब्रह्मास्मि - "I am Brahman"

#### आवरण विक्षेप (Projection/Concealment)

Maya / Ignorance has 2 powers:
* power of concealment (आवरण)
* power of projection (विक्षेप)

Just as a small cloud can obstruct the view of the sun over many miles, ignorance can conceal the true Self which is unlimited and not subject to transmigration. 
> The Self covered by this (concealing power of ignorace) may become subject to _Samsaara (संसार)_ (relative existence) characterised by one's feeling sa the agent (i.e. the doer), the experiencing subject, happy, miserable, etc., just as a rope may become a snake due to the concealing power of one's own ignorance.

>The power of projection creates all frm the subtle bodies to the cosmos.

Ignorance endowed with these twin powers of concealment and projection is the cause which transforms, as it were, the Pure Self, immutable, unattached and indivisible, into the _Jiva_ and the world. As ignorace regarding teh rope gives rise to the illution of the snake, similarly ignorace regarding the Self, by its power of projection, brings before our mind the illusion of the phenomenol universe.

_Material vs Efficient cause_
* Efficient cause: Potter making his pot (ie creator and created are seperate)
* Material cause: Milk turning into curd (creator transforms into created)

Is _Brahman_ the material or efficient cause of the Universe?

* Brahman is not the efficient cause. _Having projected it, he entered it" (Tait. Up.)
* Brahman is not the material cause. If it were, the cause and effect would be same and hence unreal.
* Brahman+Maya from His Consciousness aspect is the efficient or instrumental cause. 
* Brahman when looked upon his _Upadhi_ aspect is the material cause of the Universe.

Therefore, a new idea विवर्ता (Vivarta) is introduced. Law of _Vivarta_ means the the transformation of the caue into effect without the former losing its own character i.e., the wholevisible universe is a mere illusionary appearance - while Brahman is the only real entity. For example, a spider is the efficient and material cause of the spider web.

Law of _Vivara_ is different from law of _परिणाम_ (evolution) which admits real change to the cause.
