## tl;dr

Duryodhana's behavior in the Mahabharata is a perfect example of a _fixed_ mindset while Arjuna, the ever-curious, has a _growth_ mindset. One wants to blame and become a victim while the other wants to learn, take initiative and responsibilityтАФand grow.

## Background

I was reading the book, **Mindset** by _Carol Dweck_. In this seminal book, Carol talks about the concept of **fixed** vs. **growth** mindset.

When reading the differences, I was reminded of a specific quote attributed to Duryodhana from the Mahabharata. Moreover, Arjuna's behavior is clearly in line with a person who has a growth mindset. To me, it was eye-opening how the ancient story resonates so closely with a relatively new psychological finding.

## Mindset - the book

In her book, Carol starts with the classical question of _nature_ vs. _nurture_. She then moves on to the _why_ of _nurture_ and drills down into the core beliefs, behaviors, and attitudes of two kinds of people based on their *mindset*. According to the author,

>Mindsets are beliefsтАФbeliefs about yourself and your most basic qualities.

She then defines two types of mindset:

* Fixed Mindset: The belief that intelligence, talent, and abilities are static and unchangeable.
* Growth Mindset: The belief that abilities can be developed through dedication, hard work, and learning.

Here is a short comparison between the two kinds of mindset.

## Mahabharata

In the great work of the Mahabharata, there is a stark contrast between the behavior of Duryodhana and Arjuna. Both characters desire to win; to rule over a vast kingdom and achieve the status of the greatest warrior. Both try to win over Lord Krishna as well. However, the Lord ultimately teaches the _Gita_ to Arjuna. 

Philosophers and thinkers have wondered why Lord Krishna did not try to warn and educate Duryodhana about the perils of war. In reality, Lord Krishna did try to warn and educate Duryodhana about the perils of war. However, Duryodhana ignores him, scoffs at the warnings, and proceeds on the path to destruction. Was it because he was stupid?

### Duryodhana's Predicament

![duryodhana](https://akshayranganath-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_650/blog/mindset-duryodhana.jpg)

Duryodhana is not a stupid person. He is able to strategize, win over allies, and assemble vast armies. So what made him blind to the path that he chose? In a stunning shloka, he clearly articulates the reason for his behavior.

>рдЬрд╛рдирд╛рдорд┐ рдзрд░реНрдордВ рди рдЪ рдореЗ рдкреНрд░рд╡реГрддреНрддрд┐рд░реНрдЬрд╛рдирд╛рдореНрдпрдзрд░реНрдордВ рди рдЪ рдореЗ рдирд┐рд╡реГрддреНрддрд┐рдГред <br>
рдХреЗрдирд╛рдкрд┐ рджреЗрд╡реЗрди рд╣реГрджрд┐ рд╕реНрдерд┐рддреЗрди рдпрдерд╛ рдирд┐рдпреБрдХреНрддреЛрд╜рд╕реНрдорд┐ рддрдерд╛ рдХрд░реЛрдорд┐редред

(Source: Paandava Gita)

Breaking the compound words, the shloka reads as follows:

>рдЬрд╛рдирд╛рдорд┐ рдзрд░реНрдордВ рди рдЪ рдореЗ рдкреНрд░рд╡реГрддреНрддрд┐рдГ <br>
рдЬрд╛рдирд╛рдорд┐ рдЕрдзрд░реНрдордВ рди рдЪ рдореЗ рдирд┐рд╡реГрддреНрддрд┐рдГ ||<br>
рдХреЗрдирд╛рдкрд┐ рджреЗрд╡реЗрди рд╣реГрджрд┐ рд╕реНрдерд┐рддреЗрди<br>
рдпрдерд╛ рдирд┐рдпреБрдХреНрддрдГ рдЕрд╕реНрдорд┐ рддрдерд╛ рдХрд░реЛрдорд┐ ||

It is translated as:
>I know what is right, but I have no inclination to do it; I know what is wrong, but I cannot refrain from it. Some force seated in my heart compels me to act as I do.

Looking at the statement, Duryodhana is exemplifying the behavior of a _fixed mindset_ person. He is:

* refraining from taking ownership/control
* blaming some mysterious force that is driving him to _adharma_
* not even trying to do the right thing

### Arjuna's Contrast

There are multiple instances where Arjuna displays an ability to learn. However, the most interesting one for me is this verse:

>рдХрд╛рд░реНрдкрдгреНрдпрджреЛрд╖реЛрдкрд╣рддрд╕реНрд╡рднрд╛рд╡:
рдкреГрдЪреНрдЫрд╛рдорд┐ рддреНрд╡рд╛рдВ рдзрд░реНрдорд╕рдореНрдореВрдврдЪреЗрддрд╛: |<br>
рдпрдЪреНрдЫреНрд░реЗрдп: рд╕реНрдпрд╛рдиреНрдирд┐рд╢реНрдЪрд┐рддрдВ рдмреНрд░реВрд╣рд┐ рддрдиреНрдореЗ
рд╢рд┐рд╖реНрдпрд╕реНрддреЗрд╜рд╣рдВ рд╢рд╛рдзрд┐ рдорд╛рдВ рддреНрд╡рд╛рдВ рдкреНрд░рдкрдиреНрдирдореН || 7||

The translation is as follows:

>I am confused about my duty, and am besieged with anxiety and faintheartedness. I am Your disciple, and am surrendered to You. Please instruct me for certain what is best for me.

Source: [https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/2/verse/7/](https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/2/verse/7/)

In this, Arjuna declares he is confused and needs help. He declares that he has faith in Lord Krishna and is ready to accept guidance. Literally, he wants to develop each point from the _growth mindset_: he needs to face challenges, needs feedback on how to proceed, and wants to develop himself as a better person. 

#### рд╢реНрд░рджреНрдзрд╛ / Faith

In the Indian system of teaching, any student is expected to display at least two qualities:

* Readiness to learn
* A sense of рд╢реНрд░рджреНрдзрд╛ (_shraddha_) or faith. This is faith that the teacher knows the subject matter and that the student can actually learn from him/her.

It is important to clarify that this is faith and not _blind faith_. Translated to practical terms, it means the following: even if you want to be the next greatest scientist, you have to learn the concepts with faith that they are mostly correct. Only after mastering them can you challenge the rules and even break new ground.

## Closing Thoughts

If you notice the _Gita_, Lord Krishna does not begin his teaching until Arjuna declares his readiness. Only after this verse do the real philosophical teachings begin. To me, this was a fascinating discovery. The concept of mindset is so vividly illustrated on the grandest scale possible in the greatest spiritual work of _Sanatana Dharma_.

>__Moral__: Show respect to the position of a _guru_ (teacher), have _shraddha_ (faith) in the subject matter to master anything. Having achieved it, you can then respectfully challenge show your way of thinking.
