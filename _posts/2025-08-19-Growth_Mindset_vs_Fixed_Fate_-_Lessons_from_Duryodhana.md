## tl;dr

Duryodhana's behavior in Mahabharata is a perfect example of _fixed_ mindset while Arjuna, the ever-curious has a _growth_ mindset. One wants to blame and become a victim while the other wants to learn, take initiative and responsibility - and grow.

## Background

I was reading the book, **Mindset** by _Carol Dwek_. In this seminal book, Carol talks about the concept of **fixed** vs a **growth** mindset.

When reading the differences, I was reminded about a specific quote attributed to Duryodhana from Mahabharatha. Moreover, the behavior of Arjuna is clearly in-line with a person who is on a growth mindset. To me, it was eye-opening on how the ancient story resonates so closely with a relatively new psychological finding.

## Mindset - the book

In her book, Carol starts with the classical question of _nature_ vs _nurture_. She then moves on the _why_ of _nurture_ and drills down into the core beliefs, behaviors and attitudes of 2 kinds of people based on the *mindset*. According to the author,

>Mindsets are beliefs ‚Äî beliefs about yourself and your most basic qualities.

She then defines 2 types of mindset:

* Fixed Mindset: The belief that intelligence, talent, and abilities are static and unchangeable.
* Growth Mindset: The belief that abilities can be developed through dedication, hard work, and learning.

Here is a short comparison between the 2 kinds of mindset.

## Mahabharatha

In the great work of Mahabharatha, there is a stark contrast between the behavior of Duryodhana and Arjuna. Both characters desire to win; to rule over vast kingdom and achieve the status of the greatest warrior. Both try to win over Lord Krishna as well. However, the Lord ultimately teaches the _Gita_ to Arjuna. 

Philosophers and thinkers have wondered why Lord Krishna did not try to warn and educate Duryodhana on the perils of the war. In reality, Lord Krishna did try to warn and educate Duryodhana about the perils of the war. However, Duryodhana ignores him, scoffs at the warnings and proceeds on the path to destruction. Was it because he was stupid?

### Duryodhana's Predicament

![duryodhana](https://akshayranganath-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_650/blog/mindset-duryodhana.jpg)

Duryodhana is not a stupid person. He is able to strategize, win over allies and assemble vast armies. So what made him blind to the path that he chose? In a stunning shloka, he clearly articulates the reason for his behavior.

>‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§Ç ‡§® ‡§ö ‡§Æ‡•á ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§µ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§Ç ‡§® ‡§ö ‡§Æ‡•á ‡§®‡§ø‡§µ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§É‡•§ <br>
‡§ï‡•á‡§®‡§æ‡§™‡§ø ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•á‡§® ‡§π‡•É‡§¶‡§ø ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§§‡•á‡§® ‡§Ø‡§•‡§æ ‡§®‡§ø‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡•ã‡§Ω‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ø ‡§§‡§•‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ã‡§Æ‡§ø‡•§‡•§

(Source: Paandava Gita)

Breaking the compound words, the shloka reads as follows:

>‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§Ç ‡§® ‡§ö ‡§Æ‡•á ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§µ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§É <br>
‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø ‡§Ö‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§Ç ‡§® ‡§ö ‡§Æ‡•á ‡§®‡§ø‡§µ‡•É‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ø‡§É ||<br>
‡§ï‡•á‡§®‡§æ‡§™‡§ø ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•á‡§® ‡§π‡•É‡§¶‡§ø ‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§§‡•á‡§®<br>
‡§Ø‡§•‡§æ ‡§®‡§ø‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§É ‡§Ö‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ø ‡§§‡§•‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ã‡§Æ‡§ø ||

It is translated as:
>I know what is right, but I have no inclination to do it; I know what is wrong, but I cannot refrain from it. Some force seated in my heart compels me to act as I do.

Looking at the statement, Duryodhana is exemplifying the behavior of a _fixed mindset_ person. He is:

* refraining from taking ownership / control
* blames some mysterious force that is driving him to _adharma_
* doesn't even try to do the right thing

### Arjuna's Contrast

There are multiple instances where Arjuna displays an ability to learn. However, the most interesting one for me is this verse:

>‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§™‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§¶‡•ã‡§∑‡•ã‡§™‡§π‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ:
‡§™‡•É‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø ‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§¢‡§ö‡•á‡§§‡§æ: |<br>
‡§Ø‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§Ø: ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§ø‡§§‡§Ç ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ç‡§π‡§ø ‡§§‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ‡•á
‡§∂‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á‡§Ω‡§π‡§Ç ‡§∂‡§æ‡§ß‡§ø ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§™‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§Æ‡•ç || 7||

The translation is as follows:

>I am confused about my duty, and am besieged with anxiety and faintheartedness. I am Your disciple, and am surrendered to You. Please instruct me for certain what is best for me.

Source: [https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/2/verse/7/](https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/2/verse/7/)

In this, Arjuna declares he is confused and needs help. He declares that he has faith in Lord Krishna and ready to accept guidance. Literally he wants to develop each point from _growth mindset_: needs to face challenge, needs feedback on how to proceed and wants to develop himself as a better person. 

#### ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§æ / Faith

In the Indian system of teaching, any student is expected to display at least 2 qualities:

* Readiness to learn
* A sense of ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß (_shraddha_) or faith. This is a faith that the teacher knows the subject matter and that the student can actually learn from him/her.

It is important to clarify that this is faith and not _blind faith_. Translated to practical terms, it means the following: even if you want to be the next greatest scientist, you have to learn the concepts with a faith that it is mostly correct. Only after mastering it can you challenge the rules and even break new grounds.

## Closing Thoughts

If you notice the _Gita_, Lord Krishna does not begin his teaching until Arjuna declares his readiness. Only after this verse does the real philosophical teachings begin. To me, this was a fascinating discovery. The concept of Mindset is so vividly illustrated on the grandest scale possible in the greatest spiritual work of _Sanatana Dharma_.
