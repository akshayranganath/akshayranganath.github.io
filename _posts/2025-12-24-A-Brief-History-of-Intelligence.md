description: Advaita vedanta says that reality is a myth from a specific perspective. In the book, "A Brief History of Intelligence", the author appears to agree. My thoughts.

Do you remember the movie "The Matrix" where Neo is offered the choice to take the red pill or the blue pill? He has to decide if he wants to know the truth or live in his made-up reality? Well - it looks like we've been living in something similar after all! Let's take a look.

## A Brief History of Intelligence
**Evolution, AI and the Five Breakthroughs that made our brain**

In this [incredible book](https://www.amazon.com/Brief-History-Intelligence-Humans-Breakthroughs/dp/B0BCC76563/ref=sr_1_1), the author Max Bennet explores the working of human brain. However, he approaches it from the point of view of neural networks.

Until now, we've been trying to decode our brain. Often, we've hit road blocks. However, the world of AI has been rapidly progressing. So his argument is as follows - 

- If the brain is modeled based on neural networks and if we can observe the behavior of neural networks better than the brain, can we find similarities in the way they work? 
- If we do find them similar, can the learning from one field help in the growth of the other?

He covers the vast gamut of how the brains evolved, starting right from single celled organism to the most complex beings. However, the point of this blog is one specific aspect - how does the brain __perceive__ the world?

### Senses & Perception

#### Perception - Classification Problem

We perceive the world around us through our senses. We think that we "see" things, "hear" sounds and so on. However, the reality is a bit more nuanced.

- light hits an object.
- light is reflected by the object.
- this reflected light hits light sensors in our eyes.
- some sensors detect lines, some detect edges
- these basic patterns are then "assembled" into a higher order shape
- the "assembled" information is passed on to brain
- the brain then does a "classification" and identifies this as an object like a book.

#### Perception - Generation Problem

The same problem can be re-framed as a "generation" problem. Our eyes detect something and through the noise, our brain "generates" an image of the world. All the other senses too do the same thing.

Let's say I forget my specs. There is a book on a table about 10 feet away. I can barely "classify" it as a book. I may "hallucinate" and classify it as a book. My brain knows that books are normally kept here.

The other person predicts with a much higher probability.

So where doe all this lead us?

#### Objective vs Subjective Reality

One of the core tenants of modern science used to be that "reality" is objective. Things exist outside of the realm of "conscience" and individual perceptions. However, discoveries like [uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle) and [quantum entanglement](https://www.sciencenewstoday.org/what-quantum-entanglement-really-means-in-everyday-terms) questioned this very assumption.

Based on the formulation of this book, it stuck me that the author is basically saying that the so called "reality" is either a "classification" or a "generation". In either case, we are "hallucinating" our reality. Since neural networks are stochastic (i.e. probabilistic), the same reality is perceived differently by 2 individuals.

Anecdotally speaking, this is simple to understand. In his book, the [Seven Habits of Highly Effective People](https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/1982137274/ref=sr_1_1), Stephen Covey introduced this famous puzzle. In the same image, some people see a young woman while others see an old lady. So there are 2 realities that co-exist.

![image - is it old or a young woman](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2e/26/af/2e26af84d8d7160a47e38663b43e6ec6.gif)


So we can agree that the same reality may appear _different_ based on how our mind interprets. Let's look at another aspect - waking vs dreaming.

#### Waking vs Dreaming

We all know that our brain is hallucinating when dreaming. The whole story, the actors, the plot, the chase - everything exists in our mind. When we wake up, this _reality_ vanishes.

However, if you carefully consider that our brain is aways in the mode of classification/generation, there is actually no difference between waking and dreaming. Perhaps the difference is the amount of "hallucination". For those coming with the world of AI, it means we're constraining the temperature but, the output is still stochastic.

So, where is the link to __advaita__?

## Waking, Dreaming and Reality

One of the highest [_upanishads_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishads) is called the  [_Mandukya Upanishad_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandukya_Upanishad). Advaita philosopers generally read this work based on the commentary called [_Mandukya Karika_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaudapada#Mandukya_Karika). It was composed by Sri Adi Shankara's teacher's teacher - Sri Gaudapaada.

According to the work, it starts with 3 states of awareness:

1. Waking (Jagrat) - when both body and senses are active
2. Dreaming (Svapna) - when only senses are active
3. Deep Sleep (Sushupti) - when both senses and body are inactive

However, it starts to demolish these beliefs. In short, here's what the work has to say.

- Both waking and dream are structured by a perceiving mind and consist only of appearances to that mind.
​- Their objects lack enduring, independent reality; they arise and vanish like illusions.
​- The only apparent difference is that dream objects seem “internal” and limited in space, while waking objects seem “external,” but this is not a difference in their truth‑status.
​- Therefore, sages speak of waking and dream as essentially one more dream, superimposed on non‑dual consciousness.
