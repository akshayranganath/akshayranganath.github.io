After listening and reading to the introductory _Advaita_ Vednata book, [Vedanta Saara](/Notes-from-Vedantasaara-Sadananda/), I was intrigued to understand the core teachings of the alternative schools. In his talk, _Swami Sarvapriyananda_ had spoken about the book, [Bhakti Schools of Vedanta](https://www.vedanta.com/store/bhakti_schools_of_vedanta.htm). I was fortunate enough to find a copy and some time to read through it. Here are some quick notes from this book.

>The common object of all these systems may be stated thus: They seek to establish the supremacy of the Divine Personality, known under the different sacred names of Purushottama, Narayana, Vasudeva, Krishna, etc. and equate Him with Brahman the Absolute of the Upanishads. For them, the Supreme Being is Person with atributes and there is no Absolute beyond Him. They also lay stress on the exclusive position of devotion and Divine grace as the only means to overcome the hold of Karma on the Jiva and enable him to attain salvation. Salvation or release from the hold of Karma does not mean for them the mergence of the Jiva in Brahman, but attaining to the status of an eternal servant of His, which alone can give unalloyed bliss to the Jiva. Most of these teachings are theological... p31

## Sri Ramanuja Philosophy

![Sri Ramanujaacharya](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Ramanujacharya.jpg)

### Theory of creation and problem of evil

There is no absolute originals as souls (Jivas) and changeful nature (Jagat) always exist as a part of Brahman as His body or mode. They exist in the two states of latency (Pralaya) and patency (manifestation or Sristi). Pralaya and Sristi are eternally continuing states of universal Nature like night and day.. p43

Being an eternally recurring cyclic process, God is free from the responsibility of starting it and causing the evils accruing from it. It is Karma, the result of the action of Jivas in previous embodiments, that causes the good and evil, enjoyments and sufferings of Karma which have got necessarily to be enjoyed or suffered by those responsible for them. God does not create those efficiencies as He does not create Nature... God only provides the manifestation power. He is not responsible for the evil and sufferings involved in the creating process.

Knowledge for the Jiva consists in his recognition of his being only an absolutely dependent entity whose purpose is only to serve the Lord and not gain any personal enjoyment apart from it. p46

Unlike in Sankara's system, there is nothing like subject-objectless consciousness in Visistadvaita  metaphysics. Such a conception is dubbed as a metaphysical fiction. p56

### Freedom of will

(_My summary_)
In this system, God only wills fruictification of Karma accrued by the Jiva. God is like light - it can be used for forging or reading scriptures. The merit or demerit devolves entirely on the person concerned and not on the light. The Jiva when it identifies with body-mind may accrue bad Karma. Knowledge is identification of the Jiva as only a Sasira (body) of God and he is a Sesa (servant) of Lord will all the actions be burnt in the fire of knowledge.

.. the most intimate and personalized name for the Supreme Being is Naraayana synonymous with Vishnu. Naraayana means He who is the ayana (dwelling place) i.e. the source, support and dissolving ground of all Naras or Jivas including inert matter too. p69

### Problem of Theology

In the Semitic religions which uphold the idea of a formless God with human attributes, religion becomes gradually the acceptance of certain dogmas and social practices. Prayers become petitions addressed to some vague entity. Gradually social cohesion and not spiritual experience, becomes their aim and religion becomes highly politicized.

## Sri Nimbraka

![Nimbraka](https://cdn.britannica.com/11/133411-050-F57DAED3/Nimbarka-Sri-Golok-Dham-Ashram-New-Delhi.jpg)

Termed as द्वैताद्वैत, this philosophy is called _duality in unity_ and is very similar to the भेदाभेद [(Bhedaabheda) philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhedabheda) of Bhaskara adopted to the _Vaishnava_ theology.

Bhaskara criticized the two tiers of Reality, the really real पारमार्थिक (Paramaarthika) vs the apparently real व्यवहारिक (Vyavahaarika). He claimed that this is not mentioned in the _Upanishads_ and was adopted from the शून्यवाद (ie Nihilistic school of Buddhism). 

For Nimbraka,
>God is essentially formful and the substrate of all auspicious attributes. When the Upanishads speak of Him as _nirguna_, it only means that He is not subject to the Gunas or Prakriti. So also _nirvishesha_ (without attributes) means He is without attributes born of neiscience as in the case of wordly objects to whom those attributes are limitations. p94

### Kinds of Jivas

Though all Jivas are potentcies of Brahman, Nimbraka's system recognizes a kind of Taratmaya, gradation, among them. Some of them are Nityamuktas or eternally free. They had never been in bondage. They are eternally engaged in Divine service as His ornaments.. Then there are the bound souls, Baddhas. Some of them are मुमुक्षु  (Mumukshus) or seekers after libration striving for that consummation. There are also some others oblivious to spiritual values and are wallowing in worldliness. They are Nitya-baddhas, the eternally bound. p97


## Sri Madhavacharya

![Sri Madhavacharya](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Jagadguru_Madhvacharya.jpg)

### Dvaita Philisophy

Madhava
>preferred to call his system emphaticaly as pure dvaita (Dualism) - the doctrine of Reality as having two aspects the स्वतन्त्र (svatantra / Independent) and the परतन्त्र (paratantra / Dependent). The Independent is God or Brahman, and the Dependent are the Jiva (soul), Prakriti (Primordial Matter) and other ontological entities. The difference between the Independent and the Dependent is complete and eternal, as it is the basic and irrevocable nature of Reality. p128 The Dvaita is further elaborated into पञ्च बेध (5-fold difference). The 5 differences are between:

1. Jiva and Jiva
2. Ishvara and Jiva
3. Ishvara and Jada
4. Jada and Jiva
5. Jada and Jada (p144)

### Metaphysics

Madhava defines a valid sense experience as यथार्थ (yathartha), knowledge of facts as they are. The fact experienced may rapidly or slowly undergo change, but that does not subtract from its reality. Permanence of any nature is not necessary for any entity to be real.

In Madhava's system of realism, consciousness is always bi-polar - that is, there must be a knower ज्ञाता (jnaata) at one end, and an object ज्ञेय (gneya) at the other end. There is nothing like subject-objectless consciousness. This holds true for dreamless sleep. 

The significance of this is that there are two types of objective perception - one through the meditation of the mind alone and the other through sense contacts with outside objects. p129

### Theory of Evil

(My summary)

In Madhava's system, the Independent and Dependent co-exist and the Dependent is not generated by _Him_ from _Himself_. 

In Dualism, avidya (ignorace) is located in the dependent Jiva and does not affect the Brahman in any way. So there is no need for a concept like _Maya_. 

* Ramanuja - all _Jivas_ are same after liberation
* Madhva - _Jivas_ remain different even after liberation

### Doctrine of Salvation

Unlike in some the other systems of Vedanta, Sravana and Manana are only subsidiary to Nidhidyaasana in Madhva's system. 

_Why Madhvas argue so much?_

A competent Guru has to give proper criticism of other opposing systems of thought, as intellectual vacillation of disciplines will not disappear otherwise. Due to this, Madhavas have been criticized for intellectual pugnacity and acrimonious attitude... According to them (Madhvas) unless systems opposed to Madhvism are criticized theradbare and their hollowness shown, one's own faith in the true doctrine will not be unshakably established. This will no doubt engender an element of exclsiveness and fanaticism as in almost all forms of theism. (p185)
