This post is quite different than the normal ones in that it is a bit philosophical and yet not too cumbersome. The post is about my thoughts and ruminations resulting from the hilarious yet thought-provoking book, [The Year of Living Biblically: One Man's Humble Quest to Follow the Bible as Literally as Possible](https://ajjacobs.com/books/the-year-of-living-biblically/).

## About the book

The book is an experiment, a journey and a challenge by the author to spend a whole year by following the teachings of the Bible literally. The key word being _literally_ - no interpretation and no excuses/short-cuts. As the author says on his website, this journey included obeying some well known rules like:

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Ten Commandments</li>
<li>Love thy neighbor</li>
<li>Be fruitful and multiply</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

However, he came across and followed some of the more obscure ones like:

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Do not wear clothes of mixed fibers.</li>
<li>Do not shave your beard</li>
<li>Stone adulterers</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

The book follows the author's journey over 365 days (and a few more..) and chronicles the daily struggles the he undergoes to stick true to words of Bible. About 3-quarter of the year is spent on living the tenets of the Old Testament and last quarter on the New Testament. Filled with a lot of episodes that will bring out a chuckle, the author does pose questions that makes you stop and reflect on your life, relationships and struggles.

## My Take-aways

I read this book to understand Judaism and Christianity. I had a rough understand that the 2 evolved over time and one was the foundation of the other. However, this book gave a quick and easy to digest overview of the religions.

Secondly, it highlighted the view about growing up _secularly_. In most cases, it is assumed that you are either a religions _right wing_ conservative or a crazy _left wing_ socialist. This book highlighted the fact that neither a self-confessed _agnostic_ person can't escape the pull of religion nor a ultra-conservative _fundamentalist_ can follow the religious text to the word.

Finally, it showed the human-quality that makes us all so endearing. For example, the author's child met fell down and the immediate reaction was to invoke a prayer, although he considered himself an agnostic person. 

Another thought provoking question was on generosity. When called to help, do we help because we _want_ or because it _says so_ in some religious book. Moreover, if we are helping someone because of the commandment, does it make our generosity any less? I guess a shorter riddle is, "Can we fake it till we make it?" with even altruism?

## Reflection on Hinduism

Like the author, I am not a deeply religious person. However, I do consider myself a _Hindu_. So I could not help try to draw equivalence between the teachings of _Hinduism_ to the teachings of the _Bible_. Some of the things stood out:

* Early _vedic_ texts were very quite detailed on the rituals and offerings. This is similar to the teachings in the Old Testament.
* _Puranas_ tend to explain the consequences of our actions and sometimes, they try to dramatize it just like some parts of the _Bible_.
* Later developments like the _Bhakti movement_ talks about a personal God and self-discovered path to salvation rather than a prescriptive approach. This is very similar to the approach of the _New Testament_ as it focuses on teachings and de-emphasizes the rituals.

Overall, I felt this a great fun to read and time well spent!
